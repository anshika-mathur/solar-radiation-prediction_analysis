# Solar Radiation Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing solar radiation data to uncover patterns and trends, cleaning the dataset, and preparing it for machine learning model implementation.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Performed data normalization and transformation for accurate analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Generated visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand relationships between variables.
   - Uncovered insights into temporal patterns and environmental factors affecting solar radiation.

3. **Data Preparation for Model Implementation**:
   - Preprocessed and formatted the cleaned data for future machine learning model development.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
